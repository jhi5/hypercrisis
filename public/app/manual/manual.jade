			h1 Quick Rules

			p Hypercrisis is a versus card game where players choose from a roster of superheroes and villains. Decks are designed to play different from one another and each has unqiue strength and weaknesses.

			p Character decks consist of 30 ACTION/UTILITY cards to represent how your character would throw down in an all-out comic book brawl. These decks also serve a life total - players deal damage to eeach other in the form of placing cards from the top of their deck to their discard pile. If no cards remain in a player's deck and that player takes any amount of damage, they will lose the game.

			p Each character deck also has unique FEAT cards that supplement the deck via powerful -one-time effects. Players choose thre FEATS at the beginning of the game and each FEAT may only be played once per game.

			h1 Getting Started

			p To being playing Hypercrisis, each player must choose a character to play as. Each character comes with a character pack consisting of that character's CHARACTER CARD, FEAT & DECK. Players construct a 30-card deck from their DECK cards.

			p Players must choose which of their FEATS will be played in the next game. Each player may choose only three FEATS per game, but are welcome to reselect those FEATS between games.

			p Once each player has chosen their FEATS, eah player then shuffles their deck. To determine turn order, one player must be selected to go first - simple methods to do this include paper-rock-scissors, dice rolls or coin flips. To finalize the setup, each player places their deck face-down on the table and displays their three chosen FEATS face-up. Any player may ask to see your FEATS at any time during the game.

			p When the game begins, each player draws three cards from the top of their deck into their hand. After drawing, each player is offered a one-time mulligan allowing them to place any cards from their hand to the bottom of their deck in exchange for drwawing that many cards from the top of their deck. This is a one-time effect per game - multiple mulligans are not allowed and should be considered cheating.

			p Once both players are satisfied with their hands, the game can begin with the chosen player beginning their first turn. As going first provides a distinct advantage, only one card may be playd from that player's hand during the first turn o the game. Players may activate one of their FEATS on their first turn. Once that player is finished with their turn, they draw two cards and pass the turn to the next player clockwise.

		p Each character pack includes 44 ACTION/UTILITY cards for the character's deck, 5 FEATS and 1 CHARACTER card. In order to being the game, each player's deck must consist of exactly 30 cards chosen from among that character's available ACTION/UTILITY cards in any combination. Players may play up to two copies of any given card in their deck.

		p In addition to the cards included in each character pack, players may choose to include up to five CROSSOVERS in their deck as well. CROSSOVERS are cards that function identically to UTILITIES except in the deckbuilding process - you may only play one copy of each CROSSOVER and only five total CROSSOVERS in your deck. Look at the CROSSOVERS available in each deck and see if you might be able to form an unbeatable superteam!

		p Each character pack includes a CHARACTER CARD for that character. These CHARACTER CARDS are useful for comparing differences between characters duing character selection. Players interested in a more unpredicatable game could even deal out character to each other randomly!

		p CHARACTER CARDS also include that character's skill - a game mechanic unique to that character. The rules text on the CHARACTER CARD i a reminder for how that skill works during the game. See if you can figure out how to play Javelin Throw using this character card.

		h1 TURN ORDER

		p Each player's turn consists of four phases in this order.

		h3 BEGINNING OF TURN PHASE

		p Any cards that have abilities that reference the beginning of a turn occur in this phase - before the active player may play any cards or attack. If there are multiple cards to consider during this phase, the active player chooses the orer in which to resolve them.

		h3 Play Phase

		p The active player may do any of the following in any order during the Play Phase.

		p Play a card from their hand. Players may play up to two cards from their hand each turn.

		p Activate a FEAT by turning it face-down. Players may activate up to one FEAT each turn.

		p Choose one of their Utilities to attack - dealing damage equal to that card's fight score to any single target. Each Utility may attack once per turn, but not on the turn they were played.

		h3 End Of Turn Phase

		p This phase occurs after the active player has announced that they are finished with their turn. Any cards that have abilities checking for the end of turn occur in this phase - before the active player draws any cards or the next player's turn begins. If there are multiple cards to consider durin this phase, the active player chooses the order in which to resolve them.

		h3 Draw Phase

		p Before the next active player may begin their turn, the formerly active player must draw two cards. If this causes that player to have more than 5 cards in their hand, they must discard down to five. If no cards remain in that player's deck, skip this phase. The turn order is then passed to the next player sitting clockwise from the active player.

		p Cards may be placed in six different zones of play during the game. Below is a diagram illustrating how to distinguish each zone.

		h3 Deck Zone
		p Your character deck is placed into this zone face-down at the beginning of the game. When your deck is empty and you take any amount of damage, you lose the game.

		h3 Feat Zone
		p FEATS are placed face-up in their own 
		zone at the beginning of the game. They are not considered to be in play, in your deck or in your discard pile.

		h3 Discard Zone
		p Cards from your deck are placed into your discard pile during the course of a game.

		h3 Hand Zone
		p Cards drawn from your deck are held here before you choose to play them. Keep your hand secret from other players!

		h3 Play Zone
		Each player's Play Zone consists of three Utility slots. When choosing to play a Crossover or Utility card, players must select a slot to place that card into. Utilities and Crossovers are played face-up onto the board and each player may only have three in play at any one time. If a player's Utility slots are full, that player may choose to replace an active card with one being played by destroying currently occupying that slot.
