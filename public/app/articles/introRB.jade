				h1.articleheading who is ROBONOBO?
				p.articletext Robonobo had become disillusioned with his short, painful life. After he was forcably digitized by the evil cosmetics company ShelterGirl, this innocent bonobo became a weaponized robot ape for hire. His life was violent. Until he was introduced to his father, a young boy named Knox. Knox took Robonobo home to become his faithful son. Despite years of Knox's father love, Robo couldn't quite shake the feeling that something was very wrong.

				p.articletext Strapped up with rockets, machine guns, bombs and battle armor, cybernetic ape Robonobo is a founding member of Knox's Villain Underground criminal organization. Childish and aloof, Robonobo was far more likely to play video games or eat cereal than rob a bank. Over time, Robo's personality began to change. He began to fight with Knox and became intense and militant. Robo's getting smarter. And Robo likes to play.

				h1.articleheading how to play ROBONOBO
				p.articletext Robonobo is easy to underestimate. With his constantly changing body and adapting brain, Robonobo is a fierce opponent for any metahuman - hero and villain alike. Via his phenominal robot AI, Robo is constantly refactoring and adjusting his own plans. This kind of machine learning means you'll have access to a diverse toolkit that is capable of squaring off with any opponent.

				p.articletext Robonobo is a defensive all-purpose deck that gives players chance against most characters. Robo's EVOLVE skill allows playing to refresh their feats and by giving you the choice, allows you to easily adjust your strategy on the fly. Focused deckbuilders could even get to a point where they are playing a Feat during every turn of the game. 
	
				p.articletext Although Robonobo's skill requires players to monitor their Feats more often than other characters, he is still a great choice for a beginning player. As an EASY character, players will find that Robonobo offers powerful utilities and lots of synergy. Robo may lack the explosive damage or combo potential that other characters possess, but makes up for that by being the most consistent character in the game.

				h1.articleheading what is ROBONOBO's skill?
				p.articletext Born from a horrific animal experimentation program, Robonobo is a disgruntled robot monkey with a weaponized body. From his fists to his skull to his feet, Robonobo is chock-full of deadly precision weapons and experimental armor polymers. Despite all this firepower, Robonobo's most dangerous weapon is his ever-evolving artificial intelligence. Robonobo is quite advanced for a juvenile and as his brain develops, the other members of the Villain Underground are getting nervous. For good reason. Robonobo's EVOLVE skill represents the steel simian's brain constantly refactoring to become more dangerous.

						h4.articleskilltext To Evolve, turn one of your face-down Feats face-up. 
				p.articletext So how does Evolve work? Just like every character, Robonobo chooses three Feats at the beginning of the game. These Feats provide powerful effects, but are single use only. After using a Feat, it is turned face-down. Evolve allows you to reset your Feat cards as long as you've already used it this game. This means that Robo is capable of using the same Feat over and over throughout the course of the game. Let's look at an example! 

				.row.articlecardrow.text-center
					.col-md-6.articlecardpanel
						h3.articlevertcardheading logic chain
						img.articlevertimg.center-block(src='../../images/rb/logicchain.png')
						h4.articleskilltext Logic Chain is an Action card avaiable in Robonobo's deck. Played by itself, it allows you to Evolve one of your Feats and then deal 2 damage to a single opponent.

						h3.articlehorzcardheading darwin matrix
						img.articlehorzimg.center-block(src='../../images/rb/darwinmatrix.png')
						h4.articleskilltext Darwin Matrix is a Utility card avaiable in Robonobo's deck. At the end of each turn, you may Evolve one of your Feats.		

				p.articletext If Darwin Matrix stays in play from turn-to-turn, you'll be able to use one of your Feats every turn. For that matter, you could use the same Feat over and over again. 

				p.articletext Let's look at another example...

				.row.articlecardrow.text-center
					.col-md-6.articlecardpanel 
						h3.articlehorzcardheading jailbreak
						img.articlehorzimg.center-block(src='../../images/rb/jailbreak.png')
						h4.articleskilltext Jailbreak is a Feat card available in Robonobo's character pack. Activated by itself, it lets you draw a card.	
					.col-md-6.articlecardpanel 
						h3.articlehorzcardheading wrist weapon
						img.articlehorzimg.center-block(src='../../images/rb/wristweapon.png')
						h4.articleskilltext Wrist Weapon is a Utility card available in Robonobo's deck. Played by itself, it sits in play waiting for you to activate one of your Feats. When you do activate one of your Feats, it gains an additional +2 Fight for the rest of that turn.	

				p.articletext These cards play quite well with each other. Let's walk through it. To start, let's say that Robonobo has used all of his Feats during this game and has a copy of Wrist Weapon in play.

				p.articletext Playing Logic Chain first will deal a bit of damage to your opponent, but more importantly gives us the ability to Evolve one of those face-down Feats. Let's Evolve our face-down copy of Jailbreak.

				p.articletext After playing Logic Chain, our next step is to activate Jailbreak. Played by itself, simply draws you a card. After using Jailbreak, it gets turned face-down again. Of course, you could always Evolve it next turn to keep the cards coming!

				p.articletext Finally, activating Jailbreak had a nice side-effect. If you activate a Feat while Wrist Weapon is in play, Wrist Weapon will instantly get a boost in its Fight Value. Since it has 0 Fight by default, using a Feat essentially turns Wrist Weapon on.  

				p.articletext As you can see, every card in Robonobo's deck is interconnected. Even cards that seem underwhelming are often improved by using your Feats every turn and keeping a consistent game plan. Want to master this monkey but not sure how to hack the gibson? Robo lives and dies by his Feats in close matchups. Be careful when choosing which Feats to Evolve and don't be afraid to change it up between games.

						h3.articlefiveheading charge cable
						h4.articlefivetext This action can create some of the most explosive turns in the game! Try combining this with Gravity Well and some Throw cards to rack up huge damage.

						h3.articlefiveheading rocket punch
						h4.articlefivetext Looking for a reason to play a deck with lots of Evolve cards? Look no further than Rocket Punch. Using this even 3 or 4 times represents a huge chunk of damage. You may need to swap it out if your opponent has a lot of Armor.
				.row.articlefiverow.text-center

						h3.articlefiveheading ape omega
						h4.articlefivetext If your deck skews aggressive, Ape Omega quickly eats away Armor and catches your opponent's attention. Lots of player damage will speed the game up by a few turns so this requires an answer fast.

						h3.articlefiveheading monkey's paw
						h4.articlefivetext Do you wish Robo had efficient ways of destroying Utilities? This does the job even if it isn't always as useful as you might want. In the right deck with fewer Evolve cards, Monkey's Paw is a nightmare for your opponent.

						h3.articlefiveheading skull plating
						h4.articlefivetext Skull Plating's 4 HP and 5 Armor are certainly efficient enough to play by themselves, but Robo's bulky Armor sources are perfect targets for combo cards like Anti-Virus and Grooming. Need a pillow fort? Look no further.
