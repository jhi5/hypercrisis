				CHARACTER ORIGIN
				h3 Robonobo had become disillusioned with his short, painful life. After he was forcably digitized by the evil cosmetics company ShelterGirl, this innocent bonobo became a weaponized robot ape for hire. His life was violent. Until he was introduced to his father, a young boy named Knox. Knox took Robonobo home to become his faithful son. Despite years of Knox's father love, Robo couldn't quite shake the feeling that something was very wrong. 

				Strapped up with rockets, machine guns, bombs and battle armor, cybernetic ape Robonobo is a founding member of Knox's Villain Underground criminal organization. Childish and aloof, Robonobo was far more likely to play video games or eat cereal than rob a bank. Over time, Robo's personality began to change. He began to fight with Knox and became intense and militant. Robo's getting smarter. And Robo likes to play.

				h1.text-right HOW DOES SHE FIGHT?
			.col-md-12.charactermechanics
				h3 Gravity Girl's greatest strength lies in her versatility. Although she can't do any one thing particularly well, she's capable of dishing out player damage, blowing up Utilities and protecting her life total via her diverse Utilities and Throw cards.

				h3 This versatility can make Gravity Girl incredibly difficult to prepare for - forcing more specific & focused characters like Deadeye & Query to change their strategy on the fly. Gravity Girl makes an excellent introduction to the game and a solid all-around pick.

				h3 Gravity Girl's greatest strength is also her greatest weakness as this versatility comes at the cost of raw power. Unlike characters such as Robonobo & Obscurity, Gravity Girl can't easily change her deck around to meet different types of threats. An aggressive Knox or discard-based Deadeye can give Gravity Girl a lot of trouble while Robonobo's consistent player damage forces her to struggle when playing defense.

				h3 In addition, Gravity Girl may be one of the hardest characters to deckbuild in the game. Since each Throw card requires there to be a Utility already in play, creating a comfortable balance between cards that Throw and cards that like to be thrown can take a lot of consideration and tinkering.

				h1.text-right WHAT ARE HER POWERS?
			.col-md-12.characterskill
				h3 Gravity Girl's skill Throw represents her ability to throw around people, places & things thanks to her incredible gravity powers. Whenever you see the word Throw on a card, that means you must first destroy one of your own Utilities in order to play the card. You can't hold onto a stop sign and throw it at Robonobo's head at the same time, after all. 

				h3 Although Throw seems like it may be difficult to use, Throw cards provide Gravity Girl with a steady stream of powerful options. There are a lot of Utilities and Crossovers in Gravity Girl's deck that love to be thrown - and allow you draw cards, deal damage to opponents or blow up Utilities in the process. Throw is also an excellent defensive option - opponents that came to break your Utilities will be pretty disappointed when you are more than willing to break them yourself. You could even build a deck based on your aggressive Throw cards and end up with an empty Utility belt at the end of each turn.

				h1.rbfavfivecardtitle Shrapnel Storm
				h3.favfivecarddesc This action doesn't throw anything or draw you any cards, but can create some of the most explosive turns in the game. Try combining this with Gravity Well and some Throw cards to rack up huge damage!

				h1.rbfavfivecardtitle Dunk
				h3.favfivecarddesc Although Gravity Girl's deck provides you plenty of versatility, sometimes you need to close the door on your opponent entirely. This Feat destroys every single Utility and Crossover in the game at the low cost of one of your own.

				h1.rbfavfivecardtitle Dark Blades
				h3.favfivecarddesc Gravity Girl will throw anything around, but there's no better partner for her than Dark Blades. His decent Fight score combined with the ability to blow up a Utility when thrown makes him an excellent choice for Gravity Girl's Crossover lineup.

				h1.rbfavfivecardtitle Dreams Of Space
				h3.favfivecarddesc Although cards like Maple Tree and Pile Of Rubble help, Gravity Girl has a hard time keeping her hand full during the game. Almost every Gravity Girl build can use Dreams Of Space - especially against discard-heavy characters like Robonobo & Deadeye.
