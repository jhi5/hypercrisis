						h4.articleskilltext To play a card with Throw, you must first destroy one of your own Utilities.

				p.articletext How does Throw work? Gravity Girl loves to pick up anything that's lying around and use her gravity powers to hurl it at her opponents. In order to do this, you'll need something to pick up in the first place. Cards in Gravity Girl's deck that feature Throw cannot be played unless you have a Utility or Crossover to throw. The Utility that gets thrown may get destroyed, but many cards in Gravity Girl's deck offer big bonuses when they are blown up. Let's look at a few examples!

						h4.articleskilltext Throw It Into A Portal! is an Action card available in Gravity Girl's deck. Played by itself, it provides you the opportunity to throw one of your Utilities in order to place one of your opponent's Utilities on top of their deck.

						h4.articleskilltext Laser Sights is a Utility card also available in Deadeye's deck. Played by itself, it increases your Aim score at the beginning of your turn.			

				p.articletext Throw It Into A Portal does require you to destroy one of your own Utilities, but that also allows you to mix-and-match abilities by choosing what to destroy. Let's check out another example.

						img.articlehorzimg.center-block(src='../../images/gg/picnictable.png')
						h4.articleskilltext Picnic Table is a Utility card available in the Gravity Girl deck. Played by itself, it does nothing waiting for you to destroy it. If you do, it deals 3 damage to any one opponent.

				p.articletext These two cards work quite well together. Let's walk through it! Javelin Throw is a powerful card for dealing with Utilities. Dealing 4 damage will destroy 90% of all Utilities and Crossovers in the game. It also has Throw, meaning that we'll need to destroy a Utility in order to play it.

				p.articletext On the other hand, Picnic Table doesn't do anything. It doesn't have any Armor and can't Fight. Why play it? Because Picnic Table combines well with Throw cards. By choosing Picnic Table when using Javelin Throw, you will be able to deal 4 damage to a Utility and 3 damage to a player! That's 7 damage with only two cards!

				p.articletext Combining Throw cards with Utilties that like to be thrown is the key to mastering Gravity Girl. Gravity Girl is capable of switching between combo, defensive and offensive decks just by choosing different Throw cards! Want to win with Gravity Girl without feeling a bit dense? Gravity Girl can be difficult to deckbuild so don't be afraid to make tweaks. You might leave yourself empty-handed without a good ratio of Utility to Throw cards!
