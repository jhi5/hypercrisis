	h3 Say what you want about the superhero business, but Obscurity is one of the good ones. With her cheerful attitude and deductive reasoning, Obscurity has a long record of putting dangerous criminals in jail. Lots of supervillains come to Amberville underestimating Obscurity due to her sunny personality, but the disappearing detective has saved thousands of lives since forming the Amberville Heroes. To play Obscurity, you'll have get comfortable sitting back and staying safe instead of throwing punches. Never give up!

	h3 Obscurity is a grindy control deck that has the potential to outlast any character in the game. Her VANISH skill allows players to hide powerful Utilities from their opponent between turns. Some gadgets give you special bonuses when you VANISH them, so take extra care to keep your most valuable tools safe. If you want to combine powerful Utilities with strong card draw and healing, Obscurity is your girl.

	h3 Obscurity is the least aggressive character in the game, but that doesn't mean she can't win. If left alone, Obscurity's gadgets begin to snowball in a way that buries her opponent over time. Since Obscurity has been classified as an INTERMEDIATE character, it may take players a bit of time to adjust to the slower pace but once you've got her figured out, Obscurity buys patient players a lot of time and safety.

	h1 SKILL
	h3 A detective first and superhero second, crack gumshoe Obscurity uses her invisibility powers to sneak around crime scenes and ambush unsuspecting criminals. Non-confrontational, Obscurity often prefers to avoid fighting but keeps her ankle-length trenchcoat packed full of magnet guns, static grenades, unbreakable handcuffs and half-eaten granola bars. If all else fails, her piston-like robotic legs are capable of kicking a hole through a concrete wall. Obscurity's VANISH ability lets your gadgets stay hidden from your opponent until you are ready to close the case!

	h2 VANISH
	h3 To VANISH, turn one of your Gadgets upside down. Face-down Gadgets can be VANISHED to turn them face-up but otherwise do not exist.   

	h3 So how does VANISH work? Some of the Utilities in Obscurity's deck are Gadgets. By keeping your most valuable Gadgets hidden from your opponent, you'll be able to use them turn after turn. By turning your Gadgets face-down by using Vanish, opponents simply can't do anything until you turn them face-up again by Vanishing them a second time. Plus, many Gadgets have special abilities that fire every time you Vanish them so don't be afraid to pull the trigger! Let's check out a few examples.

	h3 Static Grenade is a Utility card available in Obscurity's deck. As you can see by the sub-type underneath the card title, Static Grenade is also a Gadget. That means that Obscurity can Vanish Static Grenades to turn it upside-down. Face-down Utilities are hidden from all players until they are turned face-up and Vanishing face-down Gadgets will turn them face-up. 

	h3 Played by itself, Static Grenades sits in play waiting for you to vanish it. When you do Vanish Static Grenades, it deals 1 damage to each opponent and their Utilities. This ability triggers each time you Vanish Static Grenades, regardless whether it is face-up or face-down. There is no limit for the number of times you are able to Vanish a given Utility per turn, so Vanishing this multiple times means dealing huge damage!

	h3 Let's look at another example!

	h3 Crack Shot is an Action card available in Obscurity's deck. Many of Obscurity's Actions give you the choice of choosing between multiple options. Played by itself, Crack Shot lets you deal 2 damage to any target or Vanish one of your Gadgets. 

	h3 Vibro-Knuckle Dusters is a Utility card available in Obscurity's deck. Played by itself, Vibro-Knuckle Dusters sits in play waiting for you to Vanish it. When you do Vanish Vibro-Knuckle Dusters, you may play the top card of your deck for free.

	h3 These two cards work well together. Let's walk through it. Let's say your turn begins with a copy of Vibro-Knuckle Dusters in play face-down. Since it is face-down, you won't be able to deal damage with it's Fight score until you turn it face-up. Let's play a copy of Crack Shot. Crack Shot gives us the choice of dealing 2 damage to any target or Vanishing our Vibro-Knuckle Dusters. Turning our Gadget face-up would let us attack and allows us to play the top card of your deck for free thanks to the Dusters' bonus ability. It's entirely possible we find another set of Knuckle Dusters!

	h3 As you see, playing Obscurity is all about measuring your options and making difficult decisions, After all - she is a detective. By sitting back and thinking long-term, Obscurity can grind out her opponent by using her Gadgets turn after turn after turn. Struggling with this case? Try to protect one powerful Gadget like Pastel Pistol or X-Ray Spex instead of spreading your Vanish triggers around.

	h2 Casing The Scene
	h3 When your deck is also your life total, drawing cards can be a bit of a mixed bag. Go low to keep the cards flowing and stay defensive. Go high to find a specific card early or strike back against a discard player.
