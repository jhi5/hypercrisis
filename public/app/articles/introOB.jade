				h1.articleheading what is OBSCURITY's skill?
				p.articletext A detective first and superhero second, crack gumshoe Obscurity uses her invisibility powers to sneak around crime scenes and ambush unsuspecting criminals. Non-confrontational, Obscurity often prefers to avoid fighting but keeps her ankle-length trenchcoat packed full of magnet guns, static grenades, unbreakable handcuffs and half-eaten granola bars.

						h4.articleskilltext To VANISH, turn one of your Gadgets upside down. Face-down Gadgets can be VANISHED to turn them face-up but otherwise do not exist.

				p.articletext So how does VANISH work? Some of the Utilities in Obscurity's deck are Gadgets. By keeping your most valuable Gadgets hidden from your opponent, you'll be able to use them turn after turn. By turning your Gadgets face-down by using Vanish, opponents simply can't do anything until you turn them face-up again by Vanishing them a second time. Plus, many Gadgets have special abilities that fire every time you Vanish them so don't be afraid to pull the trigger! Let's check out a few examples.

				p.articletext As you can see by the sub-type underneath the card title, Static Grenade is also a Gadget. That means that Obscurity can Vanish Static Grenades to turn it upside-down. Face-down Utilities are hidden from all players until they are turned face-up and Vanishing face-down Gadgets will turn them face-up.

				p.articletext This ability triggers each time you Vanish Static Grenades, regardless whether it is face-up or face-down. There is no limit for the number of times you are able to Vanish a given Utility per turn, so Vanishing this multiple times means dealing huge damage

				p.articletext These two cards work well together. Let's walk through it. Let's say your turn begins with a copy of Vibro-Knuckle Dusters in play face-down. Since it is face-down, you won't be able to deal damage with it's Fight score until you turn it face-up. Let's play a copy of Crack Shot.
