				h1.articleheading WHO IS DEADEYE?
				p.articletext Raised in a warzone, the mercenary known as Deadeye lived day and night with a gun in her hand. As she escaped this world alongside her estranged sister, she kept the gun on her waist. And now, the gun has made her rich, powerful and feared. 

				p.articletext These days, Deadeye is on a permanent contract with Knox's Villain Underground. During this time, DEADEYE has quickly gained a reputation as one of the world's deadliest marksmen. Despite her constant disgust with the team's antics, Deadeye has proved to be a dangerous and loyal ally to the Villain Underground.

				h1.articleheading HOW TO PLAY DEADEYE

				p.articletext While playing Deadeye, you'll have to embrace being cutthroat.

				h1.articleheading WHAT IS DEADEYE'S SKILL?
				p.articletext Trained to handle dangerous weapons from a young age, Deadeye has excellent combat reflexes and pinpoint accuracy. As an experienced war veteran, Deadeye is also happy to utilize surveillance devices and explosives to hunt her targets. Deadeye's special skill AIM represents her ability to maximize damage by hitting your opponent right where it counts.

						h4.articleskilltext Cards in your deck give you Aim points. Whenever your Actions or Feats deal damage, add your Aim to that damage. At the end of each turn, reset your Aim to 0.

				p.articletext So how does Aim work? Your Aim score is a number that begins each turn at 0. By playing cards that increase your Aim score, you can give cards in your deck a temporary damage boost based on your Aim score. This allows you to power-up cards in your deck by waiting until you can take advantage of a big Aim bonus! Let's look at an example.

				.row
					.col-md-6.articlecardpanel
						img.articlevertimg.center-block(src='../../images/de/emptyclip.png')
						h4.articleskilltext Empty Clip is an Action card available in Deadeye's deck. Played by itself, it represents your player dealing 4 damage to one of your opponents. 
					.col-md-6.articlecardpanel
						img.articlehorzimg.center-block(src='../../images/de/lasersights.png')
						h4.articleskilltext Laser Sights is a Utility card also available in Deadeye's deck. Played by itself, it increases your Aim score at the beginning of your turn.			

				p.articletext These two cards work quite well together. Let's walk through it. If your turn begins with a copy of Laser Sights in play, your Aim score will increase from 0 to 1. That means until end of turn, all Actions and Feats you play will get a +1  damage increase. Playing a copy of Empty Clip afterwards allows you to deal 5 damage to your opponent instead of 4.

				p.articletext Let's look at another example.

				p.articletext First we will start the turn with a copy of Laser Sights in play, raising our Aim score to 1.

				p.articletext Next, let's play Spotting Targets.

				p.articletext Spotting Targets is an Action card available in Deadeye's deck. Played by itself, you get to increase your Aim score by 2 and draw a card afterwards. Combined with the bonus received from Laser Sights, our Aim score for this turn is now 3!

				p.articletext Finally, here's Trick Shot.

				p.articletext Trick Shot is another Action card found in Deadeye's deck. Played by itself, it increases your Aim score by 1 and then deals 2 damage to any Utility. Played after Laser Sights and Spotting Targets, our Aim score raises to 4. That means that instead of dealing the 2 damage printed on the card, Trick Shot now allows you to deal 6 damage any Utility. That's a huge bonus!

				p.articletext Creating big Aim scores to deal huge amounts of damage is her biggest advantage in the game. With the Aim score reseting to 0 every turn, you'll need to find a way to sustain momentum. Still struggling to get big AIM scores? Look to Deadeye's Utility and Feats to set up sweet headshots a few turns ahead of time.

				h1.articleheading FIVE DEADEYE CARDS TO WATCH OUT FOR

				img(src='../../images/de/explosiverounds.png').articlefivevertimg
				h2.articlefiveheading Explosive Rounds
				h3.articlefivetext Two points of Aim alongside 3 damage to any target is a great deal. This card is a signpost for what Deadeye does best - big damage out of nowhere.

				img(src='../../images/de/newclip.png').articlefivehorzimg
				h2.articlefiveheading New Clip
				h3.articlefivetext Deadeye really struggles with finding extra cards to keep her hand full, so New Clip is great to have on-demand whenever you might need it. This may come at a risk if your opponent is too aggressive! 

				img(src='../../images/cross/thwip.png').articlefivehorzimg
				h2.articlefiveheading Thwip!
				h3.articlefivetext Deadeye's sister Thwip! deals with any problem for one turn and sticks around to brawl afterwards. With her decent armor and ability to protect your Aim combo pieces, this card will help you win games.

				img(src='../../images/de/spoilsofwar.png').articlefivehorzimg
				h2.articlefiveheading Spoils Of War
				h3.articlefivetext You might need a bit of incentive to include this in your deck, but in Deadeye's discard strategy this is a powerful engine for keeping your opponents hand size down. It's also great insurance against another discard player.	

				img(src='../../images/de/duckdown.png').articlefivevertimg
				h2.articlefiveheading Duck Down
				h3.articlefivetext You can use Duck Down to grab crossovers, powerful defensive options like Decent Cover or a scope to improve your Aim. Don't count this one out.
