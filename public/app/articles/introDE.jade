						h4.articleskilltext Cards in your deck give you Aim points. Whenever your Actions or Feats deal damage, add your Aim to that damage. At the end of each turn, reset your Aim to 0.

				p.articletext So how does Aim work? Your Aim score is represented by a number that begins each turn at 0. Increasing your Aim score provides your Actions and Feats with a temporary damage boost. DEADEYE players can take advantage of this powerful ability by waiting for a big Aim bonus! 

				p.articeltext Let's look at an example...

				.row.articlecardrow.text-center

						h4.articleskilltext Empty Clip is an Action card available in Deadeye's deck. Played by itself, it represents your player dealing 4 damage to one of your opponents.

						h3.articlehorzcardheading laser sights
						img.articlehorzimg.center-block(src="http://res.cloudinary.com/jhi5/image/upload/e_auto_contrast,q_54:420,r_25/v1498676135/lasersights.jpg")
						h4.articleskilltext Laser Sights is a Utility card also available in Deadeye's deck. Played by itself, it increases your Aim score by 1 at the beginning of your turn.			

				p.articletext These two cards work quite well together. Let's walk through it. 

				img(src="")

				p.articletext If your turn begins with a copy of Laser Sights in play, your AIM score will increase from 0 to 1. That means until end of turn, all Actions and Feats you play will get a +1 damage increase. 

				img(src="")

				p.articletext Empty Clip's card text says to deal 4 damage to our opponent, but by adding our +1 AIM bonus it deals 5 damage instead! Since your AIM score resets to 0 at the end of your turn, make sure to use your AIM while you can!  

				p.articletext Let's look at another example...

				.row.articlecardrow.text-center
					.col-md-6.articlecardpanel
						h3.articlevertcardheading spotting targets
						img.articlevertimg.center-block(src="http://res.cloudinary.com/jhi5/image/upload/e_auto_contrast,q_54:420,r_25/v1498676135/spottingtargets.jpg")
						h4.articleskilltext Spotting Targets is an Action card available in Deadeye's deck. Played by itself, you get to increase your AIM score by 2 and you may draw a card afterwards. 
					.col-md-6.articlecardpanel
						h3.articlevertcardheading trickshot
						img.articlevertimg.center-block(src="http://res.cloudinary.com/jhi5/image/upload/e_auto_contrast,q_54:420,r_25/v1498676135/trickshot.jpg")
						h4.articleskilltext Trick Shot is another Action card found in Deadeye's deck. Played by itself, it increases your AIM score by 1 and then deals 2 damage to any Utility.

				p.articletext Let's try to go for a big AIM score!

				img(src="")

				p.articletext First we will start the turn with a copy of Laser Sights in play, raising our AIM score to 1.

				img(src="")

				p.articletext Next, let's play Spotting Targets. Spotting Targets will increase our AIM score by 2. Combined with the bonus received from Laser Sights, our AIM score for this turn is now 3!

				p.articletext Let's play Trick Shot last.

				img(src="")

				p.articletext Combining the bonus from Laser Sights, Spotting Targets & Trick Shot our AIM score raises to 4. Trick Shot's card text says that it deals 2 damage to Utility, but that's without including our AIM bonus. By adding our +4 AIM bonus, Trick Shot deals 6 damage any Utility. Headshot!

				p.articletext Creating big AIM scores to deal huge amounts of damage is DEADEYE's biggest advantage in the game. With the AIM score resetting to 0 every turn, DEADEYE players need to sustain momentum to break through defensive characters. Still struggling to get collect your payment? Look to Deadeye's Utility and Feats to set up sweet AIM combos a few turns ahead of time.

					.col-md-6.articlefivepanel
						h3.articlefiveheading new clip
						h4.articlefivetext Deadeye really struggles with finding extra cards to keep her hand full, so New Clip is great to have on-demand whenever you might need it. Risky if your opponent is too aggressive!
