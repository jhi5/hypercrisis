				h1.articleheading who is QUERY?
				p.articletext The blank-faced spy QUERY woke screaming inside the identity eraser machine. They remembered nothing except the facility's blueprints. Breaking out of the gulag led to being followed around every corner. Picking up pieces of their past life proved to difficult but in the process, QUERY began stealing dangerous information and making powerful enemies.  

				p.articletext A collector of secrets, QUERY has spied on superheroes and supervillains alike. With their impeccable disguise skill, QUERY changes faces, genders and personalities to infiltrate the lives of their targets. QUERY could be anywhere collecting intricate details to be exposed with the world. At least, until recently. Since the joining the Amberville Heroes, Query has taken on the role of an altrustic superhero and trusted ally. What changed? Why did they join the team in the first place? Who knows?

				h1.articleheading how to play DEADEYE
				p.articletext As a former intelligence agent, QUERY has dedicated their life to playing voyeur: bugging telephones, hacking video feeds and impersonating the powerful. As a hero, not much has changed. Despite QUERY's grey sense of morality, this disinformation expert has proved to be a scrappy and loyal ally in the fight against crime in Amberville. If you want to play as QUERY, prepare to watch, wait, demean, confuse and steal from your opponent. Why start a war if you can win before throwing a punch? 

				p.articletext QUERY is a aggressive disruption character that eats defensive and combo decks alive. QUERY's SPY skill let you play a few turns ahead while keeping your opponents away from the best cards in their deck. QUERY can also use this ability to set up heists - stealing the best cards from the top of your opponent's deck and playing them for free.
	
				p.articletext Playing QUERY requires an incredible amount of patience. As one of the most fragile characters in the game, you'll be forced to constantly watch your back and prepare for the worst. Due to QUERY's limited defensive options, they have been classified as an INTERMEDIATE character - meaning that it may take a few games to figure out how to play QUERY well. If you are up to the challenge, QUERY's deck offers a lot of options to help drive your opponent up the wall.

				h1.articleheading what is QUERY's skill?
				p.articletext Does QUERY have superpowers? It's hard to tell. What's known for sure is that QUERY has an obsessive focus on surveillance - watching and recording their allies and opponents at all times. Through the use of stolen military technology and expert disguise techniques, QUERY is also capable of breaching secure facilities and stealing valuable secrets. Attacking their opponent's personal relationships, bank accounts and identities, both heroes and villains are hesitant to pick a fight with the faceless agent. With a long list of enemies, players can use QUERY's SPY skill to stay one step ahead of your opponent.

						h4.articleskilltext Choose target player. Look at the top 3 cards of their deck then return them in any order.

				p.articletext So how does SPY work? Whenever you SPY, you must choose a player to spy on and then look at the top 3 cards of their deck. You can even SPY on yourself to see what you will be drawing next! After you are finished looking at the 3 cards, return them to the top of that player's deck in any order you choose. By rearranging your opponent's deck, you can prevent them from drawing useful cards or even dealing damage to get rid of a problem permanently! 

				p.articletext Let's look at a few examples...

						h4.articleskilltext Gathering Intelligence is an Action card available in the QUERY deck. Played by itself, you first choose a player to Spy on and draw a card afterwards.

						img.articlevertimg.center-block(src="http://res.cloudinary.com/jhi5/image/upload/e_auto_contrast,q_54:420,r_25/v1498676135/falseflagattacks.jpg")
						h4.articleskilltext False Flag Attacks is another Action card avaiable in the QUERY deck. Played by itself, you first choose a player to Spy on and deal 2 damage to any one target.

				p.articletext Gathering Intelligence and False Flag Attacks are two of the SPY cards available in the QUERY deck. Both cards allow you to look at the top 3 cards of a deck and rearrange them. These cards may look similar, but actually play quite differently. 

				p.articletext Gathering Intelligence is a great way to snag a specific card in your deck. By choosing to SPY on yourself, you get to look at 3 cards from the top of your deck and choose which one to draw. That makes it 3 times more likely that you'll find a useful card! It's not quite as useful if you choose to SPY on your opponent. 

				p.articletext False Flag Attacks on the other hand is an incredibly aggressive way to disrupt your opponent. By choosing to SPY on enemies, you could keep them off of their big combo or get rid of a pesky Crossover. If you really need to get rid of something you've found, you can use the 2 damage to knock those cards into the discard pile. 

				p.articletext Let's look at another example...

				.row.articlecardrow.text-center

						h3.articlehorzcardheading lightning bug
						img.articlehorzimg.center-block(src="http://res.cloudinary.com/jhi5/image/upload/e_auto_contrast,q_54:420,r_25/v1498676135/lightningbug.jpg")
						h4.articleskilltext Lightning Bug is a Utility card available in the Query deck. When played by itself, it does nothing until you attack with it. However if Lightning Bug does attack a player and deal damage, you will be able to SPY on that player. Keep in mind that damage blocked with armor doesn't count!

						h3.articlevertcardheading seizing assets
						img.articlevertimg.center-block(src="http://res.cloudinary.com/jhi5/image/upload/e_auto_contrast,q_54:420,r_25/v1498676135/seizingassets.jpg")
						h4.articleskilltext Seizing Assets is an Action card available in the Query deck. Played by itself, it lets you look at the top card of any one opponent's deck and determine whether to play or destroy it.

				p.articletext These two cards work well together. Let's walk through it.  

				p.articletext Seizing Assets allows you to steal the top card of your opponent's deck. This is a powerful ability, but also quite high-risk. There's no guarantee that what you steal will actually be useful.

				p.articletext That's where Lightning Bug comes in. Since Lightning Bug lets you look at the top 3 cards of your opponent's deck and rearrange them, you'll be three times more likely to steal the card you need. Making the most of your steals is important so don't be afraid to wait for the right moment!

				p.articletext SPY has a variety of uses for QUERY, but most importantly it allows you to stay turns ahead of your opponent. QUERY can't shrug off hits very easily, so it's important to see your opponent's strategy coming and cut them off. Want to win with QUERY but can't quite connect the dots? Use QUERY's beefy arsenal of Utilities to distract your opponents while setting up game-winning heists. Stealing high-price targets like DEADEYE's Aim cards, ROBONOBO's Evolve cards or powerful Crossovers can close the door on games in an instant.

					.col-md-6.articlefivepanel
						h3.articlefiveheading paranoid delusions
						h4.articlefivetext Paranoid Delusions puts your opponent in an awkward position - they have to give away their best Utility or allow you to begin eating away the cards in their hand. Keep this fed and watch it take over a game.

					.col-md-6.articlefivepanel
						h3.articlefiveheading who am i?
						h4.articlefivetext The obvious play here is to Spy on yourself in order to know what you will be revealing, but sometimes you just need to refill your hand. In any case, flip this and watch your opponents squirm.

					.col-md-6.articlefivepanel
						h3.articlefiveheading dr. doodad
						h4.articlefivetext If Dr. Doodad manages to even get one hit on your opponent, she's earned her place on the team. By using Spy to keep opponents off of their removal, you'll be able to buy yourself even more time on the operating table.

					.col-md-6.articlefivepanel
						h3.articlefiveheading savate kick
						h4.articlefivetext Does it get any better than this? You may not have room for it in your ultra-defensive deck, but it will get rid of most Utilities and is always capable of finishing off a vulnerable opponent.

					.col-md-6.articlefivepanel
						h3.articlefiveheading music box
						h4.articlefivetext Query is fragile. Very fragile. Music Box seems innocuous, but provides much-needed armor and an incredible rate of healing from turn-to-turn. Nothing in your deck is better at buying the time you need to steal a victory.
