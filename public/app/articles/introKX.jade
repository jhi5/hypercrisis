				h1.ar-heading.kx-bg.f-oku.wtxt who is KNOX?
				p.ar-text Behold The Boy Warlord KNOX! Despite his pompous speeches and aversion to combat, this teenaged crime boss is at the top of every government agency's most wanted list for murder, extortion, fraud and more. Wearing a mech suit stolen from a fallen superhero's grave, Knox concocts grand plans inside his remote mansion surrounded with hired criminals and feral dogs. Although KNOX's schemes never go as planned, his Villain Underground superteam has developed a dangerous reputation. When playing KNOX, give in to your greed. Draw as many cards as you can. Kill off your lackeys. Look out for number one.

				p.ar-text KNOX is an aggressive rushdown character who tramples over slow control and combo players. KNOX's MINION skill allows him to avoid big chunks of player damage without being forced to commit to armor or healing. As this skill is limited to Utilities, many of your aggressive cards can also be cashed-in to avoid damage. KNOX also loves to draw as many cards as possible in order to find aggressive threats and speed up the game.
	
				p.ar-text Playing KNOX means being comfortable with burning through your deck at a rapid pace and keeping the pressure up at any costs. This all-out play style means that the design team has classified Knox as an INTERMEDIATE character. Newer players may not immediately be comfortable with this approach due to Knox's fragility, but experienced KNOX players can be the scariest opponents to see across the table. If you want to be aggressive and back defensive players into a corner, consider hiring the boy warlord and his Villain Underground!

				h1.ar-heading.kx-bg.f-oku.wtxt what is KNOX's skill?
				.col-md-6
					p.ar-text Although KNOX keeps a number of metahumans on the payroll, he has no superpowers himself. A vengeful coward, Knox hides inside an armored powersuit and behind a small army of brainless goons. Don't mistake this cowardace for kindness - KNOX has leveraged his wealth and power to steal relics from the gods and execute superheroes in the streets. KNOX's MINION ability allows players to hide behind their henchmen while crafting horrible plots to strike at your enemy's heart!

					p.ar-text So how does MINION work? Some Utilities in your deck have the MINION skill. When a Utility with MINION is in play, you may destroy that card to prevent one instance of damage dealt to you directly. By playing Utilities with MINION, Knox can avoid big chunks of damage without relying on other methods stay in the game. You can even get rid of multiple MINIONS in one turn if you find yourself under attack!

						p.ar-text In this example, we're going to exploit a few of our minions. You can follow along below or check out an animated tutorial by using the button controls! 
						br
						p.ar-text Cannon Fodder is a Utility card available in Knox's deck. Played by itself, it has no card text other than MINION. Anytime you would take damage, you may destroy this card instead.
						br
						p.ar-text Moronic Gangster is a Utilty card available in Knox's deck. Played by itself, it has no card text other than MINION. Anytime you would take damage, you may destroy this card instead.
						br
						p.ar-text Cannon Fodder and Moronic Gangster are two of many Utilities from KNOX's deck with the MINION skill. That means whenever you have one of these cards in play, you can destroy one of them to block damage dealt to you directly. Since MINIONS only prevent individual instances of damage, it's a good idea to have multiple MINIONS in play to keep yourself safe.
						br
						p.ar-text Throw It Into A Portal is great at getting rid of pesky Utilities while Barrage goes directly for your opponent. This versatility is GRAVITY GIRL's greatest strength, especially since you can further mix-and-match abilities by choosing which Utilities to destroy.

						p.ar-text Collateral Damage is an Action card available in Knox's deck. Played by itself, it deals 4 damage to each player. Playing Collatoral Damage by itself would deal 4 damage to your opponents and yourself, but we can do better than that!
						br
						p.ar-text Cut-Rate Mercenary is a Utility card also available in Knox's deck. Played by itself, it draws you a card and also has the MINION skill. Anytime you would take damage, you may destroy this card instead. Let's play Cut-Rate Mercenary before playing Collateral Damage so that we can avoid some damage!
						br
						p.ar-text Playing Collatoral Damage by itself would deal 4 damage to your opponents and yourself, but since you have a Cut-Rate Mercenary in play let's avoid that. By choosing to destroy your Cut-Rate Mercenary in reaction to taking damage, Collateral Damage deals 4 damage to your opponents and leaves you unscathed!

				h1.ar-heading.kx-bg.f-oku.wtxt in conclusion...
				p.ar-text Playing Knox will require you to choose which of your MINIONS live and die. Many of Knox's Utilities are very aggressive and Knox can offer lots of support to those MINIONS via his Actions and Feats. Want to help KNOX take over the world? Focus on keeping three Utilities in play at all times in order to keep the pressure up. Draw as many cards as it takes to make secure your ultimate victory!
